The goal of the Quake Live Map Manager is to making playing unofficial Quake 
Live maps in practice mode simple.  Playing these unofficial maps is possible
now, but quite cumbersome.  First you must copy the maps to the correct Quake
Live folder and then set the map file to read only.  Furthermore, if you want
to play many different unofficial maps, you must be careful to not copy too
many maps to the folder simultaneously (Some users have reported browser/plugin
crashes in this situation).  Then you must start a practice match specifying
all desired game options, then once in game, bring down the console and type
"/map <mapname>".  The map names are easy to forget, misread, or misspell.
Inspired by the Greasemonkey script for RAZ3R's training map and peleon's
excellent Quake Live Demo Player Firefox add-on, I set it to write my own 
add-on to streamline the process of playing unofficial maps.


Step 1:  Get Some Maps 

Here are some links to get you started:

Step 2: Create a folder for all your unofficial Quake Live Maps

Note that this is NOT one of the Quake Live folder's.  I keep mine at
Desktop\qlmaps. Also, don't create subfolders.  Just dump all the files
in the same folder.

Step 3: Install the Quake Live Map Manager plugin

It should install automatically.  If you end up downloading it accidentally,
find the qlmapmngr.xpi file and double click it.  Tell it open with Firefox
when prompted.  You will need to restart Firefox.

Step 4: Tell the Quake Live Map Manager where your unofficial maps folder is.

From the Firefox menu, select Tools -> Quake Live Map Manager -> Settings and
browse to the folder containing your Quake Live maps.

Step 5: Play!

Click the "Map Manager" link the Quake Live Map Manager add-on has inserted in
the Quake Live home page.  Your installed maps will be in a convenient drop down.
Select your other game options and go!
